Financial\\nstatements in accordance with IFRSs are an entity\\u2019s first IFRS financial\\nstatements if, for example, the entity:\\n(a) presented its most recent previous financial statements:\\n(i) in accordance with national requirements that are not\\nconsistent with IFRSs in all respects;\\n(ii) in conformity with IFRSs in all respects, except that the\\nfinancial statements did not contain an explicit and unreserved\\nstatement that they complied with IFRSs;\\n(iii) containing an explicit statement of compliance with some, but\\nnot all, IFRSs;\\n(iv) in accordance with national requirements inconsistent with\\nIFRSs, using some individual IFRSs to account for items for\\nwhich national requirements did not exist; or\\n(v) in accordance with national requirements, with a reconciliation\\nof some amounts to the amounts determined in accordance\\nwith IFRSs;1\\n2\\n3IFRS 1\\nA102 \\u00a9 IFRS Foundation(b) prepared financial statements in accordance with IFRSs for internal\\nuse only, without making them available to the entity\\u2019s owners or any\\nother external users;\\n(c) prepared a reporting package in accordance with IFRSs for\\nconsolidation purposes without preparing a complete set of financial\\nstatements as defined in IAS 1  Presentation of Financial Statements  (as\\nrevised in 2007); or\\n(d) did not present financial statements for previous periods.\\nThis IFRS applies when an entity first adopts IFRSs . It does not apply when, for\\nexample, an entity: \\n(a) stops presenting financial statements in accordance with national\\nrequirements, having previously presented them as well as another set\\nof financial statements that contained an explicit and unreserved\\nstatement of compliance with IFRSs;\\n(b) presented financial statements in the previous year in accordance with\\nnational requirements and those financial statements contained an\\nexplicit and unreserved statement of compliance with IFRSs; or\\n(c) presented financial statements in the previous year that contained an\\nexplicit and unreserved statement of compliance with IFRSs, even if\\nthe auditors qualified their audit report on those financial statements.\\nNotwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs 2 and 3, an entity that has\\napplied IFRSs in a previous reporting period, but whose most recent previous\\nannual financial statements did not contain an explicit and unreserved\\nstatement of compliance with IFRSs, must either apply this IFRS or else apply\\nIFRSs retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8  Accounting Policies, Changes in\\nAccounting Estimates and Errors  as if the entity had never stopped applying IFRSs.\\nWhen an entity does not elect to apply this IFRS in accordance with\\nparagraph 4A, the entity shall nevertheless apply the disclosure requirements\\nin paragraphs 23A\\u201323B of IFRS 1 , in addition to the disclosure requirements in\\nIAS 8.\\nThis IFRS does not apply to changes in accounting policies made by an entity\\nthat already applies IFRSs. Such changes are the subject of: \\n(a) requirements on changes in accounting policies in IAS 8 Accounting\\nPolicies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors ; and\\n(b) specific transitional requirements in other IFRSs.\\nRecognition and measurement\\nOpening IFRS statement of financial  position\\nAn entity shall prepare and present an opening IFRS statement of financial  position\\nat the date of transition to IFRSs . This is the starting point for its accounting in\\naccordance with IFRSs.4\\n4A\\n4B\\n5\\n6IFRS 1\\n\\u00a9 IFRS Foundation A103Accounting policies\\nAn entity shall use the same accounting policies in its opening IFRS\\nstatement of financial  position and throughout all periods presented in\\nits first IFRS financial  statements. Those accounting policies shall comply\\nwith each IFRS effective at the end of its first IFRS reporting period , except as\\nspecified  in paragraphs 13\\u201319 and Appendices B\\u2013E.\\nAn entity shall not apply different versions of IFRSs that were effective at\\nearlier dates. An entity may apply a new IFRS that is not yet mandatory if that\\nIFRS permits early application.\\nExample: Consistent application of latest version of IFRSs\\nBackground\\nThe end of entity A\\u2019s first IFRS reporting period is 31 December 20X5.\\nEntity A decides to present comparative information in those financial\\nstatements for one year only (see paragraph 21). Therefore, its date of\\ntransition to IFRSs is the beginning of business on 1 January 20X4 (or,\\nequivalently, close of business on 31 December 20X3). Entity A presented\\nfinancial statements in accordance with its previous GAAP  annually to\\n31 December each year up to, and including, 31 December 20X4.\\nApplication of requirements\\nEntity A is required to apply the IFRSs effective for periods ending on\\n31 December 20X5 in:\\n(a) preparing and presenting its opening IFRS statement of financial\\nposition at 1 January 20X4; and\\n(b) preparing and presenting its statement of financial position for\\n31 December 20X5 (including comparative amounts for 20X4),\\nstatement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity\",\n",
