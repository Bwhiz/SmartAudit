       "'IFRS 1\\nFirst-time Adoption of International\\nFinancial Reporting Standards\\nIn April 2001 the International Accounting Standards Board (Board) adopted SIC-8  First-\\ntime Application of IASs as the Primary Basis of Accounting , which had been issued by the\\nStanding Interpretations Committee of the International Accounting Standards\\nCommittee in July 1998.\\nIn June 2003 the Board issued IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting\\nStandards  to replace SIC -8. IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements  (as revised in 2007)\\namended the terminology used throughout IFRS Standards, including IFRS 1.\\nThe Board restructured IFRS 1 in November 2008. In December 2010 the Board amended\\nIFRS 1 to reflect that a first-time adopter would restate past transactions from the date of\\ntransition to IFRS Standards instead of at 1 January 2004.\\nSince it was issued in 2003, IFRS 1 was amended to accommodate first-time adoption\\nrequirements resulting from new or amended Standards. Most recently, IFRS 1 was\\namended by IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts  (issued May 2017), which added an exception to\\nthe retrospective application of IFRS 17 to require that first-time adopters apply the\\ntransition provisions in IFRS 17 to contracts within the scope of IFRS 17.\\nOther Standards have made minor amendments to IFRS 1. They include Improvements to\\nIFRSs  (issued May 2010), Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations  (issued January 2008), Severe\\nHyperinflation  and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time Adopters  (Amendments to IFRS 1)\\n(issued December 2010), IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements  (issued May 2011),\\nIFRS 11 Joint Arrangements  (issued May 2011), IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement  (issued May\\n2011), IAS 19 Employee Benefits  (issued June 2011), Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive\\nIncome  (Amendments to IAS 1) (issued June 2011), IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production\\nPhase of a Surface Mine  (issued October 2011), Government Loans  (issued March 2012), Annual\\nImprovements to IFRSs 2009 –2011 Cycle  (issued May 2012), Consolidated Financial Statements,\\nJoint Arrangements and Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: Transition Guidance  (Amendments\\nto IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12) (issued June 2012), Investment Entities  (Amendments to\\nIFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27) (issued October 2012), IFRS 9 Financial Instruments  (Hedge\\nAccounting and amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7 and IAS 39) (issued November 2013),\\nIFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts  (issued January 2014), Accounting for Acquisitions of\\nInterests in Joint Operations  (Amendments to IFRS 11) (issued May 2014), IFRS 15 Revenue from\\nContracts with Customers  (issued May 2014), IFRS 9 Financial Instruments  (issued July\\n2014), Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements  (Amendments to IAS 27) (issued August\\n2014), IFRS 16 Leases  (issued January 2016), Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards\\n2014– 2016 Cycle  (issued December 2016), which deleted several lapsed short-term\\nexemptions, IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration  (issued\\nDecember 2016), IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments  (issued June\\n2017), Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards  (issued March\\n2018) and Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020  (issued May 2020).IFRS 1\\n© IFRS Foundation A99CONTENTS\\nfrom paragraph\\nINTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARD 1 \\nFIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL\\nREPORTING STANDARDS\\nOBJECTIVE 1\\nSCOPE 2\\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 6\\nOpening IFRS statement of financial  position 6\\nAccounting policies 7\\nExceptions to the retrospective application of other IFRSs 13\\nExemptions from other IFRSs 18\\nPRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE 20\\nComparative information 21\\nExplanation of transition to IFRSs 23\\nEFFECTIVE DATE 34\\nWITHDRAWAL OF IFRS 1 (ISSUED 2003) 40\\nAPPENDICES\\nA Defined  terms\\nB Exceptions to the retrospective application of other IFRSs\\nC Exemptions for business combinations\\nD Exemptions from other IFRSs\\nE Short-term exemptions from IFRSs\\nAPPROVAL BY THE BOARD OF IFRS 1 ISSUED IN NOVEMBER 2008\\nAPPROVAL BY THE BOARD OF AMENDMENTS TO IFRS 1:\\nAdditional Exemptions For First-time Adopters  issued in July 2009\\nLimited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-time\\nAdopters  issued in January 2010\\nSevere Hyperinflation  and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time\\nAdopters  issued in December 2010\\nGovernment Loans  issued in March 2012\\nFOR THE ACCOMPANYING GUIDANCE LISTED BELOW, SEE PART B OF THIS EDITION\\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE\\nTABLE OF CONCORDANCE\\nFOR THE BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS, SEE PART C OF THIS EDITION\\nBASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\\nAPPENDIX TO THE BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS\\nAmendments to Basis for Conclusions on other IFRSsIFRS 1\\nA100 © IFRS FoundationInternational Financial Reporting Standard 1 First- time Adoption of International Financial\\nReporting Standards  (IFRS 1) is set out in paragraphs 1 –40 and Appendices A –E.
